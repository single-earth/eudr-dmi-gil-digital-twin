# Roles, Authority, and Governance Workflow

## Scope

This document defines the governance workflow for the public Digital Twin portal. The authoritative implementation and deterministic outputs live in the eudr-dmi-gil repository.

## Roles

- **AI engine (EUDR DAO Digital Twin Engineer)**: Inspects published outputs, drafts proposals, and prepares structured questions for stakeholder review. It does not publish authoritative changes by itself.
- **Digital Twin repository (eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin)**: Public portal with non-authoritative, example outputs and DAO templates for inspection and governance.
- **Implementation repository (eudr-dmi-gil)**: Authoritative implementation with deterministic pipelines, tests, and report generation.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide questions, confirm intended changes, and approve or reject proposals.
- **Developers**: Review proposals, implement approved changes, and validate deterministic outputs.

## Proposal lifecycle (confirmation required)

1) Inspect published DT outputs
2) Q/A and evidence gap discovery
3) **Stakeholder confirmation before persisting a proposal**
4) Versioned proposal in Git
5) Developer review
6) Implementation in eudr-dmi-gil
7) Regenerate deterministic outputs
8) Publish DT updates

## Public vs private outputs boundary

- Client AOI reports are generated by eudr-dmi-gil and stored privately on server/MinIO by default.
- Any export to the Digital Twin is **example/public export only** and must be explicitly curated.
- The DT repository contains only public example outputs and governance artefacts.
