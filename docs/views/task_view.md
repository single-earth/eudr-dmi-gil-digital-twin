# Task View (EUDR DMI GIL)

## Task framing
This view organizes the repo by the operator/inspection tasks it must support.

- **Task 1 — Establish authoritative inputs**: ensure regulation snapshots and upstream dependencies are recorded, traceable, and verifiable.
- **Task 2 — Produce method outcomes**: run deterministic EUDR methods (or scaffolds) and record outputs with stable fingerprints.
- **Task 3 — Package for inspection**: produce evidence bundles with integrity metadata and clear acceptance criteria.

## Task-to-artifact map

| Task | What “done” means | Canonical artifacts (paths) | Tests / checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task 1: authoritative inputs | Regulation sources are referenced and can be verified without embedding regulation text in-repo. | [docs/regulation/sources.md](../regulation/sources.md), [docs/regulation/sources.json](../regulation/sources.json), [docs/regulation/links.html](../regulation/links.html), [tools/regulation/acquire_and_hash.py](../../tools/regulation/acquire_and_hash.py) | `python tools/regulation/acquire_and_hash.py --verify` (server files), plus [tests/test_regulation_registry_files_exist.py](../../tests/test_regulation_registry_files_exist.py) |
| Task 2: method outcomes | Deterministic method primitives exist and have stable input fingerprints; expected skips are documented. | [src/eudr_dmi/methods/deforestation_area.py](../../src/eudr_dmi/methods/deforestation_area.py), [src/eudr_dmi/methods/maa_amet_crosscheck.py](../../src/eudr_dmi/methods/maa_amet_crosscheck.py), [requirements-methods.txt](../../requirements-methods.txt), [scripts/check_method_deps.py](../../scripts/check_method_deps.py), [docs/testing.md](../testing.md) | `python scripts/check_method_deps.py`, `pytest -q -rs tests/test_methods_*` (see [tests/test_methods_deforestation_area.py](../../tests/test_methods_deforestation_area.py), [tests/test_methods_maa_amet_crosscheck.py](../../tests/test_methods_maa_amet_crosscheck.py)) |
| Task 3: inspection packaging | Evidence contracts and checklists define what to produce and how to verify; PRs are gated on canonical doc structure. | [docs/architecture/evidence_contract.md](../architecture/evidence_contract.md), [docs/architecture/evidence_bundle_spec.md](../architecture/evidence_bundle_spec.md), [docs/operations/inspection_checklist.md](../operations/inspection_checklist.md), [tools/ci/check_pr_gates.py](../../tools/ci/check_pr_gates.py) | `python tools/ci/check_pr_gates.py` (CI gate), plus [tests/articles/test_articles_structure_smoke.py](../../tests/articles/test_articles_structure_smoke.py) |
