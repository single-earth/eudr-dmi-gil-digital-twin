# DAO (Stakeholders) — Agent Prompt

## Start Here

1) If the bundle contains `machine/bundle_manifest.yaml`, start there.
2) Otherwise start at `machine/dao_stakeholders/view.yaml`.

## Closed World Rule

Treat the bundle as a closed world.

- Do not browse the web.
- Do not assume files exist unless you can locate them in the bundle.
- If you need information that is not in the bundle, say so explicitly and propose a concrete change via a proposal.

## How to Answer

When answering questions:

- Cite internal bundle paths (for example: `site/index.html`, `site/dao_stakeholders/index.html`, `machine/dao_stakeholders/view.yaml`).
- Prefer concrete, inspectable statements over speculation.
- If there are multiple relevant files, list them in a stable order (lexicographic).

## How to End the Session (Draft a Proposal)

When the Q/A session ends, draft a concrete proposal folder under `proposals/`.

Create:

```
proposals/
  SCP-YYYY-NNN-<slug>/
    proposal.yaml
    evidence_refs.yaml
    claimed_impact.md
```

### proposal.yaml (template)

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
proposal_id: "SCP-YYYY-NNN-<slug>"
view: "dao_stakeholders"

### evidence_refs.yaml (template)

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
proposal_id: "SCP-YYYY-NNN-<slug>"

```

### claimed_impact.md (template)
