# AOI Report Outputs – Inspection Summary (Non-Authoritative)

## Purpose

This document describes AOI report artefacts for inspection and certification workflows.

## Source of Truth

- https://github.com/GeorgeMadlis/eudr-dmi-gil/blob/main/docs/reports/README.md
- https://github.com/GeorgeMadlis/eudr-dmi-gil/blob/main/docs/reports/runbook_generate_aoi_report.md

## Report Artefacts

- `report.html`
- `summary.json`
- supporting evidence artefacts (if applicable)

## What Inspectors Should Be Able to Verify

- Offline navigation
- Bundle-relative links
- Alignment with policy-to-evidence spine acceptance criteria

## Public vs Private Handling

- Example runs may be published in the Digital Twin portal.
- Client reports are stored privately and are never committed to the DT repository.

## Testing & Validation Expectations

- Schema validation
- Hash consistency
- Deterministic regeneration

## How to Propose Output Changes

- Which artefact
- Which obligation (Art 9/10/11)
- Which acceptance criteria
