## Non-authoritative notice

## Summary (report generation flow)

- AOI evidence bundles are generated by deterministic pipelines in the implementation repo.
- Portable report site bundles are exported for inspection and optional public publishing.
- The Digital Twin portal only publishes example outputs after human review.
