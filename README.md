# eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin

This repository publishes the public, inspectable HTML/DAO portal for the EUDR-DMI-GIL Digital Twin.

## Abbreviations

- EUDR = European Union Deforestation Regulation
- DMI = Data Management Infrastructure
- GIL = Geospatial Intelligence Layer
- DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization (procedural, non-blockchain governance model in this project)
- DT = Digital Twin
- DTE = EUDR DAO Digital Twin Engineer

## What is the Digital Twin portal?

This repository exists to support inspection, transparency, and governance by publishing static, human-inspectable HTML views and DAO templates.

It is not authoritative for code or compliance logic.

## How to view the Digital Twin portal

- HTML files viewed via `github.com/.../blob/...` are not the website.
- The portal must be viewed via GitHub Pages:

<https://single-earth.github.io/eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin/>

A portable offline bundle can be inspected by downloading the site bundle and opening `index.html` locally in a browser.

## Deployment (Git static + S3 artifacts)

This repository can be deployed in a hybrid model:

- Static portal pages remain in Git-hosted publishing (`docs/site/**`).
- AOI run artifacts are mirrored to S3 from `docs/site/aoi_reports/runs/**`.

Setup and CI details:

- [docs/ops/option-a-git-static-plus-s3.md](docs/ops/option-a-git-static-plus-s3.md)
- [scripts/sync_aoi_artifacts_to_s3.sh](scripts/sync_aoi_artifacts_to_s3.sh)
- [.github/workflows/validate-and-sync-artifacts.yml](.github/workflows/validate-and-sync-artifacts.yml)

## AOI Reports publishing policy

Only a single AOI-agnostic example run is published in this DT portal. Older AOI reports are retained on the server in the authoritative environment and are not published here.

### Artefact publication contract (DT)

- `aoi_report.json` is the source of truth for declared artefacts.
- Every declared artefact must exist at its declared relative path in the published bundle.
- `report.html` must link to the declared HTML report artefact.
- Builds fail if any declared artefact is missing or unlinked.

### Delete-before-publish invariant

Before copying a new AOI site bundle into docs/site/aoi_reports, run:

```sh
scripts/clean_aoi_reports.sh
```

This removes all existing AOI runs and the AOI reports index so stale reports cannot accumulate.

### Verify links locally

From the repo root:

```sh
scripts/check_links_local.sh
```

This verifies that docs/site/index.html and docs/site/aoi_reports/index.html resolve local file links for both GitHub Pages and file:// usage.

### AOI artefact validation and tests

From the repo root:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_aoi_run_artifacts.py
python3 scripts/test_aoi_report_renderer.py
python3 scripts/test_aoi_report_integration.py
```

### DAO reports validation

From the repo root:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_dao_reports_links.py
```

## Definitions

### DAO (Procedural DAO)

In this project, “DAO” refers to a procedural, evidence-driven governance workflow for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes. It does not refer to a blockchain-based DAO.

In this portal, the DAO is expressed as a governance interface: templates, structured questions, and proposal pages that reference published artefacts.

The intent is to make governance artefacts auditable and transparent, with deterministic outputs that can be reproduced and reviewed.

### Digital Twin (DT)

The Digital Twin is a public, inspectable, versioned representation of system state, evidence mappings, and generated outputs.

This portal publishes a versioned, inspectable state of:

- evidence mappings (e.g., policy-to-evidence spine)
- generated reports and views
- DAO templates and proposal indices

It is not a live “real-time twin” by default. Updates are published through controlled releases, via human-in-the-loop feedback loops.

## Authoritative source

The authoritative implementation repository is:

<https://github.com/single-earth/eudr-dmi-gil>

All published views originate from that repository.

## Roles, Authority, and Governance Loop

This portal is the public-facing, non-authoritative Digital Twin interface. It is aligned with the authoritative implementation and the governance workflow below.

**Roles**

- **EUDR DAO Digital Twin Engineer (AI inspection/proposal engine) (DTE)**: Inspects published outputs, drafts DAO proposals, and prepares structured questions for stakeholder review. It does not publish authoritative changes by itself.
- **eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin**: Public DT portal with non-authoritative, example outputs and DAO templates for inspection and governance.
- **eudr-dmi-gil**: Authoritative implementation with deterministic pipelines, tests, and report generation.

### Proposal lifecycle

1) Inspect published DT outputs
2) Q/A and evidence gap discovery
3) Stakeholder confirmation
4) Versioned proposal in Git
5) Developer review
6) Implementation in eudr-dmi-gil
7) Regenerate deterministic outputs
8) Publish DT updates

### Public vs Private Outputs

- This DT repository contains only public example outputs and governance artefacts.
- Client AOI reports are generated by eudr-dmi-gil and stored privately on server/MinIO; they are never committed to the DT repository.
