# eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin

This repository publishes the public, inspectable HTML/DAO portal for the EUDR-DMI-GIL Digital Twin.

## Abbreviations

- EUDR = European Union Deforestation Regulation
- DMI = Data Management Infrastructure
- GIL = Geospatial Intelligence Layer
- DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization (procedural, non-blockchain governance model in this project)

## What is the Digital Twin portal?

This repository exists to support inspection, transparency, and governance by publishing static, human-inspectable HTML views and DAO templates.

It is not authoritative for code or compliance logic.

## How to view the Digital Twin portal

- HTML files viewed via `github.com/.../blob/...` are not the website.
- The portal must be viewed via GitHub Pages:

<https://georgemadlis.github.io/eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin/>

A portable offline bundle can be inspected by downloading the site bundle and opening `index.html` locally in a browser.

## Definitions

### DAO (Procedural DAO)

In this project, “DAO” refers to a procedural, evidence-driven governance workflow for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes. It does not refer to a blockchain-based DAO.

In this portal, the DAO is expressed as a governance interface: templates, structured questions, and proposal pages that reference published artefacts.

The intent is to make governance artefacts auditable and transparent, with deterministic outputs that can be reproduced and reviewed.

### Digital Twin

The Digital Twin is a public, inspectable, versioned representation of system state, evidence mappings, and generated outputs.

This portal publishes a versioned, inspectable state of:

- evidence mappings (e.g., policy-to-evidence spine)
- generated reports and views
- DAO templates and proposal indices

It is not a live “real-time twin” by default. Updates are published through controlled releases, via human-in-the-loop feedback loops.

## Authoritative source

The authoritative implementation repository is:

<https://github.com/GeorgeMadlis/eudr-dmi-gil>

All published views originate from that repository.

## Roles, Authority, and Governance Loop

This portal is the public-facing, non-authoritative Digital Twin interface. It is aligned with the authoritative implementation and the governance workflow below.

**Roles**

- **EUDR DAO Digital Twin Engineer (AI inspection/proposal engine)**: Inspects published outputs, drafts DAO proposals, and prepares structured questions for stakeholder review. It does not publish authoritative changes by itself.
- **eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin**: Public DT portal with non-authoritative, example outputs and DAO templates for inspection and governance.
- **eudr-dmi-gil**: Authoritative implementation with deterministic pipelines, tests, and report generation.

### Proposal lifecycle

1) Inspect published DT outputs
2) Q/A and evidence gap discovery
3) Stakeholder confirmation
4) Versioned proposal in Git
5) Developer review
6) Implementation in eudr-dmi-gil
7) Regenerate deterministic outputs
8) Publish DT updates

### Public vs Private Outputs

- This DT repository contains only public example outputs and governance artefacts.
- Client AOI reports are generated by eudr-dmi-gil and stored privately on server/MinIO; they are never committed to the DT repository.
