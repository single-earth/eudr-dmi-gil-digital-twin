# eudr-dmi-gil-digital-twin

This repository publishes the public, inspectable HTML/DAO portal for the EUDR-DMI-GIL Digital Twin.

## Abbreviations

- EUDR = European Union Deforestation Regulation
- DMI = Data Management Infrastructure
- GIL = Geospatial Intelligence Layer

## What is the Digital Twin portal?

This repository exists to support inspection, transparency, and governance by publishing static, human-inspectable HTML views and DAO templates.

It is not authoritative for code or compliance logic.

## Definitions

### DAO (Procedural DAO)

In this project, “DAO” refers to a procedural, evidence-driven governance workflow for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes. It does not refer to a blockchain-based DAO.

In this portal, the DAO is expressed as a governance interface: templates, structured questions, and proposal pages that reference published artefacts.

The intent is to make governance artefacts auditable and transparent, with deterministic outputs that can be reproduced and reviewed.

### Digital Twin

The Digital Twin is a public, inspectable, versioned representation of system state, evidence mappings, and generated outputs.

This portal publishes a versioned, inspectable state of:

- evidence mappings (e.g., policy-to-evidence spine)
- generated reports and views
- DAO templates and proposal indices

It is not a live “real-time twin” by default. Updates are published through controlled releases, via human-in-the-loop feedback loops.

## Authoritative source

The authoritative implementation repository is:

<https://github.com/GeorgeMadlis/eudr-dmi-gil>

All published views originate from that repository.
